# ddpmopt
Convert meaning-less image into context meaning-full flavour.
We can use this for bitsofcotton/i2g filtered images.

# Context
There exists Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM; Ho et al. 2020). So this is another try on them.
However, we don't use them because after the some of the implementation, we only focus to enlarge with some categorized learned vector without noise. So we shrink input images to multiple meaning, then, returns one meaning output.

# Tips on malloc options
Some of the implementation needs to run them with specifying malloc options.
(cf. jjj&gt;&gt;&gt; on OpenBSD)
This is because we need huge number of allocations/frees to run.

Also, we need to do ulimit or edit /etc/login.conf for large malloc use cases required by larger than medium sized input.

Also, if we run these programs with openmp, we need large shared memory size.
They are usually configurable by sysctl on unix-like systems.
However, openmp costs large enough beat with single core even in multicore because of their (and our) memory architecture.

# Tips around topt
We recommend you and us to use puts_cc pred option instead of this.

# Usage:
    ./predg <in0.ppm> ...
    ./qredg <inout0.ppm> ...
    ./ddpmopt + <in0.ppm> ... > cache.txt
    ./ddpmopt - <inout0.ppm> ... < cache.txt
