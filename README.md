# ddpmopt
Apply some of the filter to input stream.
We can use this for bitsofcotton/i2g filtered images.

We use only input data streams they targets 6 of a measureable condition in discrete sampled ones.

# Context
There exists Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM; Ho et al. 2020). So this is another try on them but different flavoured one, we only focus to apply each pixel context to color image into monochrome one, which have the structure completely depends on filters' multiple meaning or complexity.

# Tips on malloc options
We need to do ulimit or edit /etc/login.conf for large malloc use cases required by larger than medium sized input.

Using this with mimalloc or so can increase memory usage with multi thread on some systems.

# Calculation time order.
We need at least Omega((graphics size) * (input length)^2 + (input length)^3) on first run.

# Tips on predictors
Implanted comments into lieonn.hh .

# Usage:
    # copy color structure
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? + <in0out.pgm> <in0in.ppm> ... > cache.txt
    # apply color structure
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? - <in0.ppm> ... < cache.txt
    # predict following image
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? p <markov> <bits> <loop> <in0.ppm> ...
    # reverse whole pixel context (each bit input)
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? w <in0-4.ppm> <in0.ppm> ... <addition-4.ppm>
    # predict down scanlines
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? q <markov> <bits> <loop> <in0out.ppm> ...
    # show continuity
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? [xyit] <in0.ppm> ...
    # some of the volume curvature like transform
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? c <in0.ppm> ...
    # test input series of graphics predictable or not
    ./ddpmoptp?(mp)? T<param> <markov> <bits> <loop> <in0.ppm> ...
