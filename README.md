# ddpmopt
Apply some of the filter to input stream.
We can use this for bitsofcotton/i2g filtered images.

This should behaves deterministic ones, however, some of the condition causes non deterministic flavours even ever in -D_FLOAT_BITS_=... condition.

# Context
There exists Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM; Ho et al. 2020). So this is another try on them but different flavoured one, we only focus to apply each pixel context to color image into monochrome one, which have the structure completely depends on filters' multiple meaning or complexity.

# Tips on malloc options
We need to do ulimit or edit /etc/login.conf for large malloc use cases required by larger than medium sized input.

Using this with mimalloc or so can increase memory usage with multi thread on some systems.

# Tips around c++ compilers
Some of the lieonn.hh operator \>\> class doesn't works as expected, might be compilers' bug.

# Tips after [pq]redg.
We recommend you and us to use: normalize, goki_check_cc:cleans, despeckle, equalize chain. Shrinking is important to improve output rather than persistent complement in the meaning we have on raw all-of-the-possible-context-per-image each pixel predictions.

# Usage:
    ./predg(32|64)?(mp)? <in0.ppm> ...
    ./qredg(32|64)?(mp)? <inout0.ppm> ...
    ./ddpmopt(32|64)?(mp)? + <in0in.ppm> <in0out.pgm> ... > cache.txt
    ./ddpmopt(32|64)?(mp)? - <inout0.ppm> ... < cache.txt

2023/09/19 autogamma after doing predg. update readme.
2023/09/19 predvResizeMat resize size fix to most reasonable one.
2023/09/22 ddpmopt change not to use crush but with linearInvariant.
2023/09/24 fix last up, don't know why they worked well without crash on last debug.
2023/09/25 change output size strategy, not using resize, preferring complement to predict.
2023/10/03 update readme.
2023/10/05 update readme, should close except for some of the ddpmopt for pairs of the images.
2023/10/18 update readme.
2023/10/19 mipmap impl, update readme.
2023/10/20 revert, mipmap doesn't work well.
2023/10/22 instead of complement trace of input, we should do shrink after output is done. This is from some of the numerical tests, so whole image orthogonality isn't matter even when input data is small enough, instead of them, we try to vanish some prediction errors with geometric mean.
2023/10/23 ddpmopt strategy algorithm in/output large change.
2023/10/26 update readme.
2023/10/27 update readme. close.
2023/10/30 copy structure reliably with randtools meaning.
2023/11/13 update readme.
2023/11/19 revert each line complement condition, force to use complement.
2023/11/20 only complement with 2, they smoothes output enough with our measure (&gt; 2/3).
2023/11/21 update readme.
2023/11/23 fix known tips, there was at most double error.
2023/11/25 implement and revert the test to complement before to revertProgramInvariant, they doesn't improve well differed to shrinking.
2023/12/06 fix ddpmopt.cc as makeProgramInvariant, revertProgramInvariant to better compatible with [0,1].
2023/12/07 fix ddpmopt.cc makeProgramInvariant double apply serious bug in crush. Also, update readme as compatible with in/output. realclose.
2023/12/15 use the tactics not to apply twice make/revertProgramInvariant on prediction, the invariant is already taken, however, this can causes P^t 1 == 0 condition on linearInvariant, we don't fix them.
2024/03/19 half p8 compatible change on prediction P1I to P01 with predg... qredg... binary.
2024/04/02 fix P01, vanish predvc.
