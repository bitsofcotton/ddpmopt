# ddpmopt
Convert meaning-less image into context meaning-full flavour.
We can use this for bitsofcotton/i2g filtered images.

This should behaves deterministic ones, however, some of the condition causes non deterministic flavours even ever in -D_FLOAT_BITS_=... condition.

# Context
There exists Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM; Ho et al. 2020). So this is another try on them.
However, we don't use them because after the some of the implementation, we only focus to enlarge with some categorized learned vector without noise. So we shrink input images to multiple meaning, then, returns one meaning output.

# Tips on malloc options
We need to do ulimit or edit /etc/login.conf for large malloc use cases required by larger than medium sized input.

Also, if we run these programs with openmp, we need large shared memory size.
They are usually configurable by sysctl on unix-like systems.

Using this with mimalloc or so can increase memory usage with multi thread on some systems.

# Known tips:
* P1I predicts a little rough, this is because taking data invariant and predicting same losts invariant geometric mean on prediction. This is avoidable with loop if the map region is decreasing functions.

* 2-norm on each stage prediction is a little rough, this is avoidable if we add one dimension to divides some.

* Instead of complement input traces, we need to shrink output images cf. goki_check_cc cleansq command.

* Either we select the speed instead of accuracy, so shrinking the image after output is very important.

# Usage:
    ./predg <in0.ppm> ...
    ./qredg <inout0.ppm> ...
    ./ddpmopt + <in0.ppm> ... > cache.txt
    ./ddpmopt - <inout0.ppm> ... < cache.txt

2023/09/25 change output size strategy, not using resize, preferring complement to predict.
2023/10/03 update readme.
2023/10/05 update readme, should close except for some of the ddpmopt for pairs of the images.
2023/10/18 update readme.
2023/10/19 mipmap impl, update readme.
2023/10/20 revert, mipmap doesn't work well.
2023/10/22 instead of complement trace of input, we should do shrink after output is done. This is from some of the numerical tests, so whole image orthogonality isn't matter even when input data is small enough, instead of them, we try to vanish some prediction errors with geometric mean.
